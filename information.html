			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<p>
				This seminar is envisioned to motivate the exchange of ideas between fields by establishing open communication, promoting cooperation, and broadening horizons. By exposing yourself to interdisciplinary ideas you allow the methods that may be well understood in other fields (<a href="images/teamwork.png" target="_blank">but are new to yours</a>) to enter your space, and vice versa, you may inspire scholars elsewhere to adopt your methods. Ofcourse, it needs to be specified what is meant by the terms <i>interdisciplinary</i> and <i>applied</i>. Interdisciplinary material is understood to be a collection of ideas drawing from different fields. Applied work may either be a real world application of abstract theory, or the application of an abstract field to a different field to find new solutions. We also choose to count a talk that opens up a field to non-experts as an interdisciplinary exposition. The seminar is not only open to people who are already knowledgeable in interdisciplinary forms of research, but to anyone interested. In fact, students that are specialising in either fully theoretical or fully applied disciplines may stand to learn the most from the talks given in this seminar.
			</p>
			<h2>Participation</h2>
			<p>
				There is no obligation to be present for talks, or to give a talk yourself. This removes the barrier of having to attend talks you are not interested in, and is meant to ensure both the presenter and audience are there out of their own volition. We therefore expect that everyone present at a talk is invested in the material and is willing to contribute to the discussion. Participation in this seminar may also take a different shape or form - we hope it encourages you to read more interdisciplinary work, and that if you find something truly interesting, you are willing to give a talk about it. Likewise, it should challenge you to apply your field's way of thinking to other fields. Note that we also welcome practice sessions for other presentations, which is an opportunity both to normalise your presentation for general audiences and to receive input from listeners outside of your area of expertise. <br />
			</p>
			<h2>Shared knowledge</h2>
			<p>
				Although we welcome participants from all backgrounds, we anticipate the vast majority to be active in the exact sciences. Because we are required to establish a reference point for what knowledge can be assumed from the audience, we have therefore chosen to assume mathematics that should be present in nearly all of the exact bachelor programs. Specifically, we assume familiarity with basic proof methods, calculus, linear algebra and probability & statistics. See below for a non-exhaustive list of concepts. Anything beyond this assumed understanding is expected to be reviewed at the start of your talk, in order to ensure that everyone has a fair chance at participating in the seminar. The general format for a talk is 30 minutes of presenting, followed by up to 15 minutes of questions and open discussion, after which you will receive personalised feedback. Both the talk and discussion are to be conducted in english as it is the lingua franca of modern scientific discourse. <br />
				<br />
				<i>Proof methods</i>: induction, contraposition, contradiction, construction. <br />
				<i>Calculus</i>: differentiation, integration, limits, convergence. <br />
				<i>Linear algebra</i>: vector spaces, matrices, determinants, inner products, eigenvectors, eigenspaces. <br />
				<i>Probability & statistics</i>: random variables, probability distributions, expectation, variance, estimators, statistical tests.

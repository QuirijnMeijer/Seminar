					<td><i>The Universal Approximation Theorem</i>, Quirijn Meijer</td>
					<td><b>Mathematics, Machine Learning</b> The Universal Approximation theorem states that, under a few impositions on the activation function, a single-layer neural network can approximate any continuous function on a closed and bounded domain. This talk will explain how this is proven when either the rectified linear unit or any continuous sigmoid function is used for activation.</td>

					<td><i>Nash Equilibria and Cournot Competition</i>, Quirijn Meijer</td>
					<td><b>Mathematics, Economics, Finance</b> Given a non-cooperative multiplayer game, a Nash equilibrium is a per-player choice of action so that no player can increase their payoff by changing actions. After a brief overview of game theory, the theoretical necessities for Nash's existence theorem (such as as the Brouwer fixed point theorem) are discussed before giving an illustration in the form of Cournot competition.</td>

					<td><i>Spacetime Topology</i>, <br /> Quirijn Meijer</td>
					<td><b>Mathematics, Physics</b> In physics, the theory of special relativity is formulated on Minkowski spacetime, a flat four-dimensional space made up of three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. This space can be equipped with several topologies, and after having introduced the notion of a topology, the Euclidean topology and the Zeeman path topology are considered as examples.</td>
